# Werewolf Allstars

This is a hobby project for personal and ITU Connect use.

It is a social deception game similar to Werewolf, but with custom roles (inspired by Werewolf, Town of Salem and Blood on the clocktower) and some added rules inspired by Blood on the Clocktower (e.g. that you can still participate when dead).

Feel free to create a pull-request to suggest improvements. You want to make your changes in (`ITU_Werewolf/data.txt`)[ITU_Werewolf/data.txt] and perhaps the Moderator Guide (`ITU_Werewolf/cards/Moderator Guide X.X.X.txt`)
